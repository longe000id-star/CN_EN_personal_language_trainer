# Personal Language Learning Assistant

## Overview

This is a private language learning assistant built for my own use.

It is designed to create a structured and disciplined learning system that guides regular study, generates active practice, evaluates performance, and tracks long-term progress.

All training and testing are generated strictly from selected source materials. The system focuses on controlled input and deep reinforcement rather than random content.

## Key Features

- Systematic study scheduling  
- Material-based training (listening, speaking, reading, writing)  
- Automatic test generation  
- Auto scoring and result archiving  
- Historical performance tracking  
- Data-driven feedback and improvement suggestions  
- Task and progress management  

## Scope

This project is for personal use only and is tailored to my own learning standards and goals.
