# Personal Language Learning Assistant

## Overview

This is a private language learning assistant built for my own use.

It is designed as a comprehensive virtual language trainer that integrates multiple tools and services into one structured system. The goal is to guide consistent study, generate active practice, evaluate performance, and track long-term progress.

All training and testing are generated strictly from selected source materials, emphasizing controlled input and deep reinforcement rather than random exposure.

## Integrated Tools

This system combines and orchestrates multiple platforms, including:

- API access to ChatGPT and Claude  
- Google Drive  
- Google Sheets / Google Docs  
- NotebookLM  
- YouTube  
- ChatGPT Atlas  
- Media generation tools 
- Obsidian
- Notion
- Streamlit

These components work together to form a unified, full-spectrum virtual language trainer.

## Key Features

- Systematic study scheduling  
- Material-based training (listening, speaking, reading, writing)  
- Automatic test generation  
- Auto scoring and result archiving  
- Historical performance tracking  
- Data-driven feedback and adaptive suggestions  
- Task and progress management  

## Scope

This project is strictly for personal use and is tailored to my own learning standards and long-term goals.
